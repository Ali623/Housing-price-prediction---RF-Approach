# Housing Price Prediction with Random Forest Model

This project focuses on predicting housing prices using a Random Forest model, a powerful machine learning algorithm. By analyzing various features of housing data, we aim to provide accurate and reliable predictions.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project contains information about various housing properties, including features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more. These features serve as inputs for our Random Forest model to predict the housing prices.

## Model and Analysis

In this project, we employ the Random Forest machine learning algorithm for housing price prediction. Our analysis includes the following key steps:

- **Data Preprocessing**: We preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.

- **Feature Selection**: We identify the most important features that influence housing prices using Random Forest's feature importance scores.

- **Model Training**: We train a Random Forest regression model on the preprocessed dataset.

- **Model Evaluation**: We evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared.

- **Predictions**: We use the trained model to make housing price predictions.

## Getting Started

To explore the housing price prediction model and analysis, follow these steps:

**Prerequisites**: You will need Python, Jupyter Notebook, and necessary libraries such as Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib installed on your system.
